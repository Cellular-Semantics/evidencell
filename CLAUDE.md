# CLAUDE.md — evidencell curation guide

This is the **default** guidance loaded by Claude Code in this repository. It
describes the curation workflow: which orchestrator to run, when, and with what
inputs. Curation work — KB YAML, references, reports, research artifacts, and
dev-request reports — is in scope here.

Dev work on `src/`, `schema/`, or the `justfile` is out of scope by default; see
**Curation mode** below and `CLAUDE_dev.md` for the dev-mode companion.

---

## Curation mode

Writable zones in this session:

- `kb/draft/**`, `kb/taxonomy/**` — KB YAML under pre-edit validation
- `references/**` — reference stores under ingest-path governance
- `reports/**` — generated reports under pre-edit validation
- `research/**` — research artifacts (field mappings, summaries, traversals)
- `planning/dev_requests/**` — dev-request reports (see "Hitting a wall" below)

Out of scope: `src/`, `schema/`, and `justfile`. The pre-edit hook rejects
writes to these paths in curation mode. This is a deliberate barrier against
accidental code/schema edits during curation sessions — schema fixes as a
response to a validation error are a common and dangerous anti-pattern. Code
and schema changes land through normal dev-mode sessions and PR review
against `main`, not through curation workflows.

### Hitting a wall

When a workflow step needs functionality that doesn't yet exist in `src/`, or
when a validation error reveals a real schema gap, do **not** attempt to fix
code or schema directly. Instead:

1. **File a dev-request report** at
   `planning/dev_requests/{YYYY-MM-DD}_{short-slug}.md` describing: what
   orchestrator step is blocked, what's missing, a proposed surface (what
   would need to be added or changed and where), and what was tried.
2. **Or load `CLAUDE_dev.md`** explicitly when you're authorised to do dev
   work this session. Schema changes in particular MUST be discussed and
   reviewed before implementation — they are occasionally legitimate (new
   taxonomy import, a novel mapping scenario) but almost never the right
   response to a validation error.

## How to run a workflow

When asked to run a workflow, open the referenced orchestrator in `workflows/` and execute
its steps in order. The orchestrator is the authority — do not plan independently or
research prerequisites that the orchestrator already addresses. Use the skills and tools
it references. Stop at steps marked `[GATE]` and present results for human review before
proceeding.

## KB data management principles

### Properties live on nodes; edges compare

All biological properties (markers, NT type, anatomy, sex ratio, expression
profiles) are stored on `CellTypeNode` entries. Mapping edges document how
properties on two nodes compare — they never introduce new property assertions.
This means the mapper always sees a node's full property set regardless of which
mapping graph references it.

### Taxonomy reference YAML is canonical for atlas properties

Atlas node properties belong in `kb/taxonomy/{id}/*.yaml`, not on stub nodes
inside mapping graphs. Mapping graphs reference taxonomy nodes by accession;
stubs carry only: `id`, `name`, `definition_basis`, `taxonomy_id`,
`cell_set_accession`.

**Known violation:** `precomputed_expression` blocks currently live on atlas
stubs in `kb/draft/hippocampus/hippocampus_GABAergic_interneurons.yaml`.
These should migrate to the taxonomy reference store once the update
architecture is implemented (see `planning/taxonomy_update_architecture.md`).

### Taxonomy re-ingest is currently flush-and-replace

The ingest pipeline (`just ingest-taxonomy-db`) regenerates all taxonomy YAML
from the source JSON. This is safe only when no post-ingest enrichments have
been added to the taxonomy reference YAML. Before re-ingesting, check whether
any properties have been added to `kb/taxonomy/{id}/*.yaml` since the last
ingest — if so, those will be lost.

A typed update architecture using schema-validated Python objects is planned
to support selective field-level updates and enrichment-preserving re-ingest.
See `planning/taxonomy_update_architecture.md` for the design.

### Provenance

The schema provides `PropertySource` as a general provenance record: `ref`
(PMID or DOI), `method`, `scope`, `snippet`/`quote_key`, `notes`.

As of v0.8.0, provenance is nested on property objects rather than in
separate per-property source fields. Each property carries its own `sources`
list:

- `electrophysiology.sources` — on `ElectrophysiologyProfile`
- `morphology.sources` — on `MorphologyProfile`
- `anatomical_location[].sources` — on each `AnatomicalLocation` entry
- `nt_type.sources` — on `NeurotransmitterType`
- `GeneDescriptor.sources` — as `MarkerSource` (adds `marker_type`)

This gives natural scoping (each source is attached to the assertion it
supports), clean RDF mapping (blank nodes, no reification needed), and
eliminates the former per-property field proliferation (`ephys_sources`,
`morphology_sources`, `location_sources` — all removed in v0.8.0).

`definition_references` (list of PMID/DOI strings) is retained as a
flat field — these are general node-level citations, not property-scoped.

Atlas node provenance follows a different convention: properties from
taxonomy ingest have implicit provenance from `taxonomy_meta.yaml`
(`source_file`, `ingest_date`). No per-field `PropertySource` entries are
needed on `ATLAS_TRANSCRIPTOMIC` nodes — the atlas and `cell_set_accession`
are the citation.

### Use `notes` fields, not YAML comments

YAML comments (`# ...`) are not preserved by programmatic round-trips
(e.g. `yaml.safe_load()` → `yaml.dump()`). Any annotation that must
survive automated processing — caveats, heterogeneity observations,
cross-references to other nodes — belongs in a `notes` field on the
relevant object, not in a YAML comment. Reserve comments for transient
developer-facing hints that are acceptable to lose.

## Overview

The human is the top-level coordinator. Run each orchestrator when ready, review the output at each gate, and proceed at your own pace. There is no meta-orchestrator.

| Orchestrator | Location | Phase | Status | When to run |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ingest-taxonomy` | `workflows/ingest-taxonomy.md` | Discovery | **Ready** | Ingest a taxonomy table → atlas cluster CellTypeNode stubs |
| `asta-report-ingest` | `workflows/asta-report-ingest.md` | Literature | **Ready** | Start here when you have an ASTA deep research PDF — proposes classical nodes + initial evidence |
| `survey` | `workflows/survey.md` | Literature | **Ready** | Broad snippet scan of ASTA corpus for a region → all_summaries.json; no synthesis, no KB write |
| `lit-review` | `workflows/lit-review.md` | Literature | **Experimental stub** | Seed discovery when starting without a report; may be revived; do not use in regular workflows |
| `cite-traverse` | `workflows/cite-traverse.md` | Literature | **Ready** | Citation traversal + synthesis; call as a skill for targeted follow-up, not primary discovery |
| `evidence-extraction` | `workflows/evidence-extraction.md` | Literature | **Ready** | After survey or asta-report-ingest — writes PropertySource entries with quote_key to KB YAML |
| `map-cell-type` | `workflows/map-cell-type.md` | Mapping | **Ready** | Discovery mode: queries taxonomy DB at multiple ranks (0=leaf, 1, 2…) for candidate atlas matches; hypothesis mode: tests curator's proposed mapping. Uses `just find-candidates` with rank parameter. Produces MappingEdge YAML with property comparisons. Can run on stubs (LOW confidence) or after lit review. |
| `gen-report` | `workflows/gen-report.md` | Reporting | **Ready** | Generate summary + drill-down reports from KB YAML; LLM synthesis with hallucination guard (ID/quote/PMID/accession validation via pre-write hook) |
| `annotation-transfer` | `workflows/annotation-transfer.md` | Evidence transfer | **Pipeline ready** | Dataset retrieval → MapMyCells → F1 matrix → AnnotationTransferEvidence; marker assessment moved to `map-cell-type` |

---

## Anti-hallucination infrastructure

A pre-write hook (`.claude/hooks/validate_mapping_hook.py`) runs automatically before
every `Write` or `Edit` to KB files. It is **not** an orchestrator step — it fires on all
KB writes regardless of which workflow is running.

**KB YAML** (`kb/**/*.yaml`) — blocks writes with: YAML parse errors, structural
integrity failures (dangling edges, duplicate IDs, placeholder snippets), `quote_key`
values absent from `references.json`, `PMID:`/`DOI:` citations absent from
`references.json`, LinkML schema non-conformance.

**Markdown reports** (`reports/{region}/*.md`) — blocks writes with: blockquote blocks
missing a `<!-- quote_key: X -->` attribution annotation, quote keys or PMIDs absent
from `references/{region}/references.json`.

See [`.claude/anti-hallucination-hooks.md`](.claude/anti-hallucination-hooks.md) for
the full specification and correction loop protocol.

## Typical workflow for a new mapping

Classical nodes emerge from research — they are not pre-created. Run these in
parallel where possible (taxonomy ingest + report ingest are independent).

```
── Discovery ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1a. just ingest-report {region} {pdf_file}      # ASTA report → classical CellTypeNode
    → workflows/asta-report-ingest.md            # stubs + initial asta_report evidence
    [GATE] approve proposed nodes + CL mappings

1b. just ingest-taxonomy-db {taxonomy_file} {taxonomy_id}  # full taxonomy → YAML + SQLite
    → workflows/ingest-taxonomy.md                         # (run in parallel with 1a)
    [GATE] approve field mapping + generated stubs

── Primary literature retrieval ───────────────────────────────────────────────

    corpus_ids_file: research/{region}/.../pdf_corpus_ids.json
    output_dir: research/{region}/survey_{date}/

── Evidence extraction ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

3.  workflows/evidence-extraction.md             # per-node: all_summaries.json → KB YAML
    summaries_file: research/{region}/survey_{date}/all_summaries.json
    # no paper selection gate for ASTA survey runs
    # run once per node_id

── Mapping ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

4.  workflows/map-cell-type.md                   # evidence + atlas metadata → MappingEdge
    [GATE] expert reviews proposed edges

── Reports + community ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

5.  just gen-facts {graph_file} {node_id}        # extract structured facts
    → workflows/gen-report.md                    # LLM synthesis + ID/quote validation
    [GATE] biologist reviews, executes proposed experiments

6.  workflows/annotation-transfer.md             # AT results → AnnotationTransferEvidence
```
